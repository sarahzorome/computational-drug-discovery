# Computational Drug Discovery

I built machine learning models using ChEMBL bioactivity data with a target protein, **sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)**. The pIC50 predictions enabled the discovery of data-driven insights that prove valuable for drug discovery in the context of diabetes treatment.
